# ðŸ§ª Chemical Reactor Design Calculator

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)-based calculator for designing and comparing Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) systems for first-order irreversible reactions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

* Calculate reactor volumes for specified conversions
* Compare CSTR and PFR performance
* Plot conversion profiles along reactor length
* Interactive parameter adjustment
* Real-time calculation updates
* Performance comparison visualizations

## ðŸ§® Calculations

The calculator performs the following analyses:
